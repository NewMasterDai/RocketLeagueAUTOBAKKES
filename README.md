# RocketLeagueAUTOBAKKES
Tired of launching Bakkesmod manually? Do you want it to open and close with the game instead of sitting there idly? No solution online works? Cooked up this piece of code just for you. Check this out.

# TUTORIAL

Download "RocketLeagueAB.bat.txt"

Open it inside of notpad and edit it so that the paths of Rocket League and Bakkesmod match whatever is on your PC.

It should look something like this:

![RocketLeagueAB bat txt â€” Notatnik 06 12 2024 20_08_02](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9f696cd7-480d-4616-9fde-5e46c9bc0e3b)

Save the file.

Edit the name and delete .txt extension

Your file should look something like this:

# Optional

Next make a shortcut to it (for the safety of the file from accidental deletion and for aesthetics' sake it is highly recommended)

You can edit the icon/name of the shortcut to your liking.

P.S. If you don't know how to do this just search it on Youtube, it's really not that complicated
